-> 03Closet

=== 03Closet ===

<color=\#ffffffff>The closet is filled with clothes from school to work.
You don't feel like changing, and you're too tired after such a long day.
That, and the smell of bread, isn't always a foul smell.
... Excluding the sweat and natural BO, of course...
You can always shower in the morning.
