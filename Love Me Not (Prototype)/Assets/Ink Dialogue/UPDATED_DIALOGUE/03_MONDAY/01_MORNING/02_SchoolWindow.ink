=== SchoolWindow ===

<color=\#ffffffff>You peer out of the window, the sky blue and bright.
<color=\#ffffffff>The wind blows, taking Cherry Blossoms and local leaves in its trails.
<color=\#ffffffff>Spring. A beautiful season.
<color=\#ffffffff>And the perfect time to bake a wonderful batch of bread.
<color=\#ffffffff>Enough fantasies, this beauty will still be here to see another day.
