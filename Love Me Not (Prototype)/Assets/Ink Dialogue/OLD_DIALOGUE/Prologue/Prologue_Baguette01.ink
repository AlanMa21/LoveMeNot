//MC (Happy)
"Hello Baguette!"
...
"You're my best friend Baguette, I'll never find a better pet rock then you!"
//(Confused)
Am I really talking to a rock right now?
How am I still allowed to walk the streets with no consequences?
...
//(Happy)
"Welp, guess I'll talk to you more in the morning Baguette, sleep well buddy."
//(Neutral)
An asylum sounds pretty good right now.
