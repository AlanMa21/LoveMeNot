=== Window1 ===
MC: (Neutral) "Ah, Japan. I've lived here all my life and some days it just feels too much."
MC: "Maybe if I lived somewhere else, like Paris. France is a beautiful place."
MC: "Hmm, tonight is nice though."
MC: "A full moon. How often do you see one of those?"
MC: (Tired) "I wonder if the moon is just as bright as it is here in Paris."
